                Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the shores
                of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in
                the river, unless they grew up here, in which case they've probably tried
                it at some point. Summers are hot here, and the winters are drafty, but
                the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.
              </p>
              <p class="place__paragraph">
                The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet architecture,
                all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of the
                Dnipro, the landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those
                wearing heels. The left bank is considered far less interesting and prestigious
                though, even by people who live on the far outskirts of the right one.

                The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town below
                from a rock that juts out into the sea. It is thought to have
                been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th century. Some 900
                years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of Snowdonia
                has become a popular tourist destination during the summer months.

                A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the world's
                best ice cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient is rumored to
                be locally sourced seaweed. Another claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth
                won the Wales in Bloom award for five years in a row for its spectacular
                floral displays around town. It was also home to David Lloyd George, the only
                Welshman ever to hold the office of Prime Minister of the UK.

                and&nbsp;countryside. It's known as the arts and crafts capital
                of the state, and visitors will find plenty of shopping
                opportunities: shops with handmade jewelry, candles, wood items,
                galleries, glass studios, and more. The&nbsp;town&nbsp;holds a
                yearly festival celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made with
                cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.

                However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea

                Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the kingdom era,
                Muramvya was the royal capital and in 2007, because of its cultural
                and natural landscape, it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative
                List. It is located in the center of Burundi, between the country's political

                The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you would think you're

                coldest places in the province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest
                plantations of tea and coffee in the country, which make up the bulk of Burundi's
                exports.

                beautiful mountains of the Congo-Nile Divide, ranging between 1550 and 2660 meters of
                altitude. It is filled with beautiful vegetation, and a source for the various rivers
                and streams which provide water around the country.
